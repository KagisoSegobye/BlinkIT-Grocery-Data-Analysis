Customer demographics were not included, limiting segmentation accuracy.

Sales figures represent gross values; operational costs or returns are not considered.

Outlet size and tier data are interpreted as static and may not reflect recent changes.

Inventory turnover and stockouts are not captured in this dataset, which may affect visibility metrics.
